# GrapheneOS Twemoji

This repo contain Ota images of GrapheneOS that was modified to replace the (ugly) Google Emoji, by the Twemoji (Twitter emoji).

## Why do this?

Because why not!

And also i really REALLY freaking hate the Google emoji they're so ugly.

It is also a way for me to learn how to modifiy Android images without the need to use any form of root solution.
This is first to make the phone that i use more secure, and to also prevent breaking the security of GrapheneOS.

## But how can i trust this image?

Well you can, but also not if you want.

But to build thoses OTA images, everything in the chain is verified so it cannot be compromised.
If anything in the build procces is compromised in any way, the image while never be uploaded here.

All of the commit is also signed.

So there is nothing to worry about.

It also the image that my phone use, and that why (for now) only the Pixel 9 image while be build.
